Keezer Kiosk project goal (1.0)
- to create a touch-screen intranet accessible
- LAMP website that allows for keezer management
- to add/revise/delete beers and open/close taps
- with the ability to report temp from a sensor

- include insert/update/delete ability on past/upcoming
- beers for easy brewing/keezer management.

- simple HTML pages (with .php extension)
   - use include/require to add functionality
   - leave out the ID and SQL stuff from the user
   - source pages and phpMySQLadmin tables contain SQL understanding
   - admin area for add/edit/delete
   - touch-only for users, admin will need keyboard/mouse
   - globals page for keezer name, tap count, colors

this project was developed from the original Keezer Kiosk files, but 
a full install that only requires an 8gb download and following some 
directions. There is no need to know anything about Raspberry PI or 
Debian Linux to use this. It will require an internal network to 
allow the ease of entering the history of your beers. at the time of 
this release, the apt-get is updated, but it suggested you run this 
at first connection to the internet (in the instructions). 

// WARNING //

This site was not designed for external exposure to the internet. 
Only for internal/local network. It should for no reason at all be 
exposed to the external internet. If you want to show friends/family 
take a picture or invite them over for a beer and surprise them.
